Package %{scl_name} provides PostgreSQL database management system delivered as a Software
Collection. For more information about Software Collections,
see the scl(1) man page. By installing the %{scl_name} collection,
you will get the minimum working set of packages to have a working PostgreSQL database management system.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'psql'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications
which are not located in the filesystem root hierarchy,
but are stored in an alternative location, which is %{_scl_root}
in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system (DBMS).
The postgresql-server package contains the programs needed to create
and run a PostgreSQL server, which will in turn allow you to create
and maintain PostgreSQL databases.

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Configuration for the %{scl_name} software collection is located
under %{_sysconfdir}.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{scl_name}
  software collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'psql'
  Run psql from the %{scl_name} software collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell with the %{scl_name} software collection enabled.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'man psql'
  Show man pages for the psql command, which is a part of the
  %{scl_name} software collection.
